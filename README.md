## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project is part of exercise in [Scrimba Learn class components in React](https://scrimba.com/learn/classcomponents).

## Purpose of this project

Using React class component with Lifecycle methods (componentDidMount() & componentDidUpdate) to update form's information in localStorage.

## Note 

This project's got similar result as [form](https://github.com/WKasiban/Scrimba-form) project, except the localStorage part. The main different is just the way of writing code, one is written with React hooks and this one is written with React components.
